NeoMPC is a web based MPD Client which is designed for a small screen device with a web browser, like a PDA or a mobile phone (although it’s taylored specifically for a screen 240 pixels wide, I might change it in the future to be a little more flexible).

You’ll need to be running Apache, Apache2 or Lighttpd (recommended) with PHP 4.3 or greater on your MPD server. Running it should be as simple as extracting it to the apache directory (or other web server accessible directory) and navigating to it with your browser.
